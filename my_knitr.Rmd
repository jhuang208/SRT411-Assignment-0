This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

####A Summary
```{r}
summary(cars)
```

####Plots
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Here it is again without `echo = FALSE`

```{r }
plot(cars)
```

####Embedded code
```{r, echo=FALSE}
time <- format(Sys.time(), "%a %b %d %X %Y")
```

The current time is `r time`.


##### The end
